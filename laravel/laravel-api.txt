# Laravel API by Jesus Saez ---

--- Define Models and Resources ---

Models are how the data is going to be saved and how the class where they are stored is going to look like.
Resources are how we expose data to the outside world. Resources can interact with models and handle request/response logic.
With models we model the data and map it to database tables.
We use the Eloquent ORM to comunicate with the db. 

Resources are tipically defined in separate PHP classes stored in the App/Http/Resources directory.
Cada uno de los recursos representa un unico modelo o multiples modelos.

--- Setting up Routes ---

With routes we receive requests.

Routes define how we [
	POST resources from the database,
	GET resources from the database,
	DELETE resources from the database,
	Get and return views,
];
