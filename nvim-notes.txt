We can use Visual Mode (pressing V) and a/i to select everyting
inside 

If tree-sitter is not indenting your tsx code correctly, make sure that:

require('nvim-treesitter.configs').setup({
	indent = {
		enable = true,
	},
	ensure_installed = { "typescript", "tsx" },
})

the indent config has enabled set to true.
